Requirements say: keep Device abstract; implement DoorLock, Thermostat, Camera; use Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces. I’ll extend Device and delegate connection via setConnected(boolean).

AI:
Correct. Ensure constructors call super(id, location). For batteries, validate 0..100 and throw IllegalArgumentException. getStatus() format must match exactly.

Student:
Here’s my plan:

DoorLock & Camera: implement Networked + BatteryPowered

Thermostat: implement Networked only

Main exercises heartbeat, connects devices, and prints status.

AI:
That matches the driver’s expectations. Remember to put everything in org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question4.

Student:
I’m getting Eclipse red X errors: “Device(String, String) is undefined.”

AI:
That happens if Eclipse is compiling against the wrong Device.java or it’s missing. Verify Device.java exists in the same package, unchanged. Clean/rebuild after adding it.
