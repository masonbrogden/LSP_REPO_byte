I used a generative AI assistant (ChatGPT) to help brainstorm an object-oriented redesign, suggest class responsibilities, and draft Javadoc comments. I reviewed, adapted, and tested the provided suggestions; the final code and documentation were written and verified by me.

## Example prompts and excerpts

**Prompt 1**
"How can I redesign my procedural ETL Java program into an object-oriented one? Suggest classes and responsibilities for reading CSV, transforming products, and writing CSV."

*Prompt 2**
"Include a short summary of how AI was used, at least one actual prompt, the response or excerpt, and an explanation of how the response was used/modified."

**Prompt 3**
"I included the AI usage in `REFLECTION_A3.md` and `AI_PROMPTS_A3.md` and edited the wording to match my actions."

**Prompt 4**
"Explain this project to me and explain what I am being asked to do."
